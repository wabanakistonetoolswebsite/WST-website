      My name is Jacob Cloutier and I am running for the position of councilor
      for our beloved Marysville (Ward 5).
    text: >+
      If elected, there are four key areas I plan to address:


      *   Homelessness & poverty.


      *   Infrastructure issues such as we are seeing with the Marysville
      Bridge. There have also been growing concerns with the quality of our
      sidewalks, especially during winter months.


      *   Development of a strong business and employee ecosystem for the
      Fredericton Region.


      *   Councilor wage control

      Ward 5 and Fredericton.

      leaders and professionals as I can that effect or have insight about our
      city and talk about what we are doing right and what we could do better ,
      my goal will be to meet with over 100 of these individuals at this stage I
      have met with 15.

      Born and raised in Maryville, this is where my family calls home. My
      passion lies in spending quality time with family and in our community.
      Volunteering and living in different parts of Maryville I have been

      by a thirst for knowledge and always seeking solutions, I aim to
      understand and address these challenges to improve our ward for my family
      and yours.
