          #### **✔ Vote More Provincial Support**


          Fredericton has faced growing challenges, and our city should not be
          left to shoulder this burden alone.

          Sidewalks are treacherous in winter, our bridge is hardly functional,
          transit is a mess. Together we can do better.

          The last city council gave themselves an unjust 34% raise, and that’s
          not right.

      My name is Jacob Cloutier and I am running for the position of councilor
      for our beloved Marysville (Ward 5).
    text: >+
      If elected, there are four key areas I plan to address:


      *   Homelessness & poverty.


      *   Infrastructure issues such as we are seeing with the Marysville
      Bridge. There have also been growing concerns with the quality of our
      sidewalks, especially during winter months.


      *   Development of a strong business and employee ecosystem for the
      Fredericton Region.


      *   Councilor wage control

      Born and raised in Maryville, this is where my family calls home. My

      and yours.
