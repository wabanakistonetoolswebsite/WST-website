      Wabanaki Stone Tools is an Indigenous owned business, operated by
      Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet),

      and Mi’kmaq, artist and flintknapping instructor Brian Blaze Palmater.
      Flintknapping is the art of

      shaping stones into tools, art objects, and jewellery. It is also the
      foundation necessary for the

      development of all human cultures and technologies. Whether it’s as simple
      as a knife, or as

      complicated as an integrated circuit, all human technologies are a direct
      result of our ongoing,

      and ever evolving, relationship with stone tools. The purpose of this
      business is to bring an

      appreciation for this ancient art of toolmaking to a modern audience, and
      to preserve the local

      traditions of stone tool manufacture through creation and education.

      My name is Jacob Cloutier and I am running for the position of councilor
      for our beloved Marysville (Ward 5).
    text: >+
      If elected, there are four key areas I plan to address:


      *   Homelessness & poverty.


      *   Infrastructure issues such as we are seeing with the Marysville
      Bridge. There have also been growing concerns with the quality of our
      sidewalks, especially during winter months.


      *   Development of a strong business and employee ecosystem for the
      Fredericton Region.


      *   Councilor wage control
