      Wabanaki Stone Tools is an Indigenous-owned small business dedicated to
      reviving the ancient art of flintknapping. Run by Brian Blaze Palmater; a
      Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) and Miâ€™kmaq artist and educator. Our mission is to
      preserve and pass on traditional knowledge of stone tool creation through
      both art and education.


      Flintknapping is more than just shaping stone. Itâ€™s a direct link to our
      past, the foundation of all human technology, and a deeply creative act.
      Our work brings this ancient practice into modern hands through
      storytelling, hands-on experience, and community engagement.

    subtitle: Flintknapper | Artist | Educator
    text: >+

      I am an Indigenous artist, and flintknapping instructor, from Neqotkuk (Tobique First Nation). I also have Miâ€™kmaq family ties to Ugpiâ€™ganjig (Eel River Bar First Nation). I am the only Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) flintknapper who is currently practicing my artform at a professional level, and offering workshops teaching the basic fundamentals. 

      I have been flintknapping for roughly ten years now, but I have been an artist for my entire adult life. In addition to working with stones, I also work with wood, bone, antler, and various other natural materials that have a longstanding tradition of use by Indigenous toolmakers. 

      What led me to pursue flintknapping specifically as an artform was a lifelong love of collecting stones. This interest in Geology naturally blossomed into an interest in Archeology as well, as I found myself wondering just how my ancestors went about transforming rocks into usable tools. Without local access to mentorship, or instruction, I turned to the internet, and to books, as well as Archeological and Geological survey data. What I found was a wealth of knowledge that had been recorded on the subject, but was not actively being passed down in my community. Wolastoqiyik flintknappers once had a trade network of precious knappable stones that spanned from Northern Labrador south into Maine, and possibly even beyond. Given our history as some of the most accomplished flintknappers, toolmakers, hunters, and trappers in the region, I was truly disappointed to find that the bulk of our local knowledge on the subject had been forgotten. Rather than being discouraged by this, I realized that it meant I had an opportunity to bring that knowledge back, not only to my own community, but to the wider global community as well. This is the vision and purpose that drove me to the creation of Wabanaki Stone Tools.
