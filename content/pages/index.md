      Wabanaki Stone Tools is an Indigenous-owned small business dedicated to
      reviving the ancient art of flintknapping. Run by Brian Blaze Palmater; a
      Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) and Mi’kmaq artist and educator. Our mission is to
      preserve and pass on traditional knowledge of stone tool creation through
      both art and education.


      Flintknapping is more than just shaping stone. It’s a direct link to our
      past, the foundation of all human technology, and a deeply creative act.
      Our work brings this ancient practice into modern hands through
      storytelling, hands-on experience, and community engagement.

    text: >+
      > My name is Brian Blaze Palmater. I am an Indigenous artist, and
      flintknapping instructor, from

      > Neqotkuk (Tobique First Nation). I also have Mi’kmaq family ties to
      Ugpi’ganjig (Eel River Bar

      > First Nation). I am the only Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) flintknapper who is
      currently practicing my

      > artform at a professional level, and offering workshops teaching the
      basic fundamentals. I have

      > been flintknapping for roughly ten years now, but I have been an artist
      for my entire adult life. In

      > addition to working with stones, I also work with wood, bone, antler,
      and various other natural

      > materials that have a longstanding tradition of use by Indigenous
      toolmakers.

      > What led me to pursue flintknapping specifically as an artform was a
      lifelong love of collecting

      > stones. This interest in Geology naturally blossomed into an interest in
      Archeology as well, as I

      > found myself wondering just how my ancestors went about transforming
      rocks into usable tools.

      > Without local access to mentorship, or instruction, I turned to the
      internet, and to books, as well

      > as Archeological and Geological survey data. What I found was a wealth
      of knowledge that had

      > been recorded on the subject, but was not actively being passed down in
      my community.

      > Wolastoqiyik flintknappers once had a trade network of precious
      knappable stones that spanned

      > from Northern Labrador south into Maine, and possibly even beyond. Given
      our history as some

      > of the most accomplished flintknappers, toolmakers, hunters, and
      trappers in the region, I was

      > truly disappointed to find that the bulk of our local knowledge on the
      subject had been forgotten.

      > Rather than being discouraged by this, I realized that it meant I had an
      opportunity to bring that

      > knowledge back, not only to my own community, but to the wider global
      community as well. This

      > is the vision and purpose that drove me to the creation of Wabanaki
      Stone Tools.
